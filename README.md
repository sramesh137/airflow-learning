# Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of Apache Airflow and how to use it to create and manage workflows. Airflow allows you to define complex workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), which consist of tasks and dependencies between them. These workflows can be scheduled, monitored, and managed through a web-based user interface.

### Prerequisites
Before getting started with Apache Airflow, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Python (version 3.6.x or higher) installed
2. Basic understanding of Python and programming concepts
3. Familiarity with command-line interface (CLI)
4. Access to a terminal or command prompt
5. Version Control (e.g., Git)
